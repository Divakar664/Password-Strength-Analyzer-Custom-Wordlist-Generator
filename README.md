Installation
The project uses Python 3.11 and includes the following dependencies:

zxcvbn-python - Password strength estimation
nltk - Natural language processing
tkinter - GUI framework (built-in with Python)
Dependencies are managed automatically via the Replit environment.

Usage
GUI Mode (Recommended)
Launch the graphical interface:

python main.py
or explicitly:

python main.py --gui
The GUI provides two tabs:

Password Analyzer Tab: Enter a password to get detailed strength analysis
Wordlist Generator Tab: Input user information to generate custom wordlists
CLI Mode
Analyze Password Strength
Basic analysis:

python main.py --cli analyze --password "MyP@ssw0rd123"
With user-specific inputs:

python main.py --cli analyze --password "MyP@ssw0rd" --user-inputs "john,smith,fluffy"
JSON output format:

python main.py --cli analyze --password "test123" --json
Generate Custom Wordlist
Basic wordlist generation:

python main.py --cli generate --names "john,jane" --dates "19900515" --pets "fluffy" --output wordlist.txt
With multiple input types:

python main.py --cli generate \
  --names "alice,bob" \
  --dates "20000101,19951225" \
  --pets "buddy,max" \
  --places "boston,newyork" \
  --keywords "password,admin" \
  --output targeted_wordlist.txt
With statistics:

python main.py --cli generate \
  --names "john" \
  --dates "19900515" \
  --output wordlist.txt \
  --stats
Password Analysis Output
The analyzer provides comprehensive feedback including:

Overall Strength Score: 0-4 rating (Very Weak to Very Strong)
Shannon Entropy: Information-theoretic measure of randomness
Charset Entropy: Entropy based on character set complexity
Crack Time Estimates: Multiple estimation methods
Pattern Detection: Identified weak patterns
Security Feedback: Warnings and suggestions for improvement
Example output:

============================================================
PASSWORD STRENGTH ANALYSIS REPORT
============================================================
Password: ********
Length: 8 characters
Overall Strength: Fair (2/4)
ENTROPY ANALYSIS:
  Shannon Entropy: 22.45 bits
  Charset Entropy: 47.63 bits
CRACK TIME ESTIMATES:
  zxcvbn estimate: 3 hours
  Charset-based: 2 days
  Guesses needed: 10^6.2
PATTERNS DETECTED:
  - Word Then Numbers
SECURITY FEEDBACK:
  Warning: This is similar to a commonly used password
  - Add another word or two
  - Avoid sequences
============================================================
Wordlist Generation Process
The generator applies multiple transformation techniques:

Base Variations: Case transformations (UPPER, lower, Capitalize)
Leetspeak: Character substitutions (a‚Üí4/@, e‚Üí3, i‚Üí1/!, o‚Üí0, s‚Üí5/$, t‚Üí7, etc.)
Common Suffixes: Numbers (123, 1234, 12345) and symbols (!, !!, @, #, $)
Years: Historical and recent years (1950-2029)
Combinations: Permutations of input words with various separators
Date Formats: Multiple international format variations
Reversals: Reversed strings and duplications
Example transformations for input "john":

john
John
JOHN
j0hn
J0hn
john123
John123
john2024
john!
john@
john#
nhoj (reversed)
johnjohn
Wordlist Statistics
Generated wordlists include statistics:

Total Entries: Number of generated passwords
Unique Entries: Number of unique passwords
Average Length: Mean password length
Length Range: Minimum and maximum password lengths

Technical Details
Password Strength Scoring
The tool uses multiple methods to assess password strength:

zxcvbn Algorithm: Realistic password strength estimation that considers:

Common password patterns
Dictionary words
Spatial patterns on keyboards
Repetition and sequences
Date patterns
Shannon Entropy: Measures the randomness/unpredictability of the password

Charset Entropy: Calculates entropy based on character set diversity:

Lowercase letters: +26 possibilities
Uppercase letters: +26 possibilities
Numbers: +10 possibilities
Special characters: +32 possibilities
Pattern Detection
The analyzer detects:

Sequential numbers (012, 123, 234, etc.)
Repeated characters (aaa, 111, etc.)
Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdf, etc.)
Single case passwords (all upper or all lower)
Word-then-numbers pattern (password123)
Examples
Example 1: Analyze Your Password
python main.py --cli analyze --password "MySecureP@ssw0rd2024"
Example 2: Generate Targeted Wordlist
python main.py --cli generate \
  --names "alice,bob,charlie" \
  --dates "19900101,19851015" \
  --pets "fluffy,buddy,max" \
  --keywords "company,admin,secure" \
  --output company_wordlist.txt \
  --stats
Example 3: Test Password Against User Info
python main.py --cli analyze \
  --password "Alice1990!" \
  --user-inputs "alice,bob,1990,fluffy"
